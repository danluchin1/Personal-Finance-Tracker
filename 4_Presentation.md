### ‚úçÔ∏è Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: Developed using **React** with **Tailwind CSS** for responsive and modern styling.
- **Backend**: Built with **Node.js** and **Express**, managing API endpoints for transactions and reports.
- **Database**: **PostgreSQL** stores users' transactions, budgets, and reporting data.
- **Authentication**: Secure login system implemented using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.
- **Build Tool**: **Vite** used for efficient development and fast build processes.
- **Hosting**: Deployed on **Vercel** for frontend and **Render** for backend services.

**Key Features Implementation:**

- Modular, component-based architecture for easy scalability.
- Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and consistent styling.
- RESTful API architecture for clean separation between frontend and backend.
- Secure authentication flow to protect user data.

### üöÇ Development Process

- **Phase 1 - Planning**: Defined user personas, use cases, UI wireframes, and technical stack.
- **Phase 2 - Basic Functionality**: Implemented core features ‚Äî transaction logging, reporting, and budgeting.
- **Phase 3 - Improvements**: Integrated Tailwind CSS for design, configured Vite for better developer experience.
- **Phase 4 - Presentation**: Final review, testing, documentation, and preparation of demonstration materials.

Key decisions included focusing on simplicity and usability, choosing modern technologies (React, Tailwind, Vite), and prioritizing core features based on user personas' needs.

### ‚òÄÔ∏è Reflection and Future Work

**What worked well:**

- Clear definition of requirements helped stay focused.
- Using Tailwind CSS and Vite significantly sped up the development process.
- Modular component structure made the app easy to scale and maintain.

**Challenges faced:**

- Balancing feature scope with limited development time.
- Configuring the PostgreSQL database, connecting to it and creating the desired tables.
- Integrating Vite and Tailwind initially required troubleshooting due to configuration differences.

**Future Improvements:**

- Add **automatic transaction creation** based on recurring settings (e.g., auto-log rent every month without user input).
- Add **Data Visualization** with charts (e.g., pie charts for spending categories).
- Introduce **Multi-user support** and **cloud syncing**.
